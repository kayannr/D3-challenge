          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age</h2>
          <p>The chart displayed above reveals that there is a complex correlation between age and 
            health risks. The median age in the US ranges from 30 to 44 years old, which is not noticeably 
            correlated to smoking, obesity, and healthcare. The chart shows generally clustered data points
            that means age is not an important factor in determining the health risks variations in most US states.</p>
          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Income</h2>
          <p>The relationship between income and health risks appear as a weak negative correlation. In contrast, 
            poverty has a weak positive correlation to health risks. The displayed chart shows a visible trend that indicates 
            the states with the higher household median income tend to have lower tendencies of smoking, lower obesity percentage, 
            and higher healthcare. The visible trend also shows that the higher poverty rate results in higher obesity, higher 
            smoking tendencies, and inadequate healthcare. For example, Mississippi is in the top 10 highest poverty rate, 
            lowest household median income, and highest health risks.  </p>
